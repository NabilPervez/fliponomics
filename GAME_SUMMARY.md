# Flip-O-Nomics: The Economy of the Flip

**A Game Theory Perspective on Infinite Growth**

## Overview

*Flip-O-Nomics* is a satirical incremental clicker game that explores the absurdity of exponential economic growth through the simplest mechanic possible: **flipping a coin**.

It begins as a manual labor simulation—you click a penny, you get a penny—and evolves into a high-frequency trading empire where quantum mechanisms flip coins faster than the human eye can perceive. The game challenges players to optimize their "Flip Velocity" and manage an expanding portfolio of currency, space, and automation.

## The User Experience: From Scarcity to Singularity

### Phase 1: The Manual Grind (Labor Theory of Value)
The player starts with a single slot and a Penny. 
*   **Action**: Click the coin.
*   **Outcome**: 50/50 chance of Heads ($0.01) or Tails ($0.00).
*   **Feeling**: Honest work. Slow. The player realizes that manual labor has a hard ceiling on profitability.

### Phase 2: Market Expansion (Scaling)
As the bank balance grows, the player unlocks new "markets" in the form of physical space.
*   **Progression**: Moving from a **Coaster** (1 slot) to a **Mousepad** (2 slots) to a **Card Table** (8 slots).
*   **Strategy**: More slots mean more parallel processing. The player is no longer just a flipper; they are a manager of flipping real estate.

### Phase 3: Currency Arbitrage (Value Density)
Why flip a Penny for $0.01 when you can flip a Quarter for $0.25?
*   **The Mint**: Players unlock higher-denomination coins (Nickel, Dime, Quarter, Loonie, Euro, etc.).
*   **Meme Economy**: To bridge value gaps, the game introduces meme currencies like the *Japanese Yen* ($0.02) or *Indian Rupee* ($0.07), smoothing the progression curve. 
*   **Endgame Currencies**: The player eventually flips *Bitcoins*, *NFTs*, and literal *Antimatter*, turning the act of flipping into a cosmic economic event.

### Phase 4: Automation (The Industrial Revolution)
Clicking is for mortals. The player purchases tools to automate the labor.
*   **Fidget Finger**: A basic tool that flips Slot #1 every 5 seconds.
*   **Dealer's Hand**: A skilled croupier that flips the first 4 slots every 3 seconds.
*   **Quantum Tunneler**: High-tech machinery that flips ALL slots 5 times per second.
*   **Game Theory Hook**: The player must balance the cost of automation against the marginal utility of the next upgrade. Is it better to buy a faster machine or a more valuable coin?

### Phase 5: Prestige (The Reset Loop)
The ultimate "Call of Duty" style loop.
*   **The Goal**: Reach **$100,000,000 (100 Million)**.
*   **The Choice**: Liquidation. The player presses the **PRESTIGE** button.
*   **The Result**: The bank accounts are drained. The machines are destroyed. The coins are lost. The player returns to a single Penny and a Coaster.
*   **The Reward**: A **Gold Star**. A permanent accolade that signifies mastery, displayed proudly in the HUD. The cycle begins again, but the status is eternal.

## Core Systems & Features

### 1. The Probability Engine
At its heart, every action is a probabilistic event.
*   **Standard Flip**: 50% Heads (Payout), 50% Tails (Nothing).
*   **Upgrades**: Players can rig the odds using items like *Weighted Zinc* (+5% Heads Chance) or *Magnet Core* (+8% Heads Chance).
*   **Insurance**: "Bad Luck" protection via *Floor Mats* ensures that even Tails pays out a fraction of the value.

### 2. The Table (Grid System)
The game board is a dynamic grid that expands visually. Starting with a 1x1 grid, it grows into massive layouts (e.g., *Quantum Array* with 64 slots). This visualizes the concept of "scaling up" operations.

### 3. The Audio-Visual Feedback Loop
*   **Visuals**: Satisfying 3D-style coin flip animations (CSS).
*   **Audio**: Crisp sound effects for flipping and cash registers providing immediate dopamine hits.

### 4. Prestige System
A reset mechanic designed for the "completionist." It turns the game from a linear progression into a cyclical test of efficiency. How fast can you get back to a billion?

## Summary for the Game Theorist

*Flip-O-Nomics* is a study in **optimization**. The player is constantly calculating **Expected Value (EV)**.
*   *EV = (Heads Probability * Coin Value) + (Tails Probability * Pity Pay)*
*   The player effectively becomes a central banker, managing inflation (higher coin values) and velocity of money (flip speed) to maximize the Gross Domestic Product of their desk.

It starts as a game of chance and ends as a game of inevitable, industrial-scale wealth.
